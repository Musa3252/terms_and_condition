          <h2>1. About Axcended and these Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Axcended is a learning and mentorship platform that connects
            high-school and university learners with tutors, mentors, classes,
            games, study groups and related educational content.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and the
            Axcended team that operates the Service. Additional terms may apply
            to specific features (for example, certain paid programs or
            promotions). Where there is a conflict, those specific terms will
            apply for that feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tutors, mentors and other professionals using Axcended to provide
            services must ensure they comply with any laws, regulations or
            institutional rules that apply to their work (for example, teaching
            or professional conduct requirements).
          </p>

        <!-- 3. Account security -->
        <section id="account-security">
          <h2>3. Your account, security &amp; responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            When you create an Axcended account, you agree to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate and up-to-date information.</li>
            <li>Keep your login details secret and secure.</li>
            <li>Immediately notify us if you suspect unauthorised access to your account.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account,
            including any actions taken by people using your account with or
            without your permission. If you share a device with others, we
            recommend logging out after each session.

        <!-- 4. Subscriptions & billing -->
        <section id="subscriptions">
          <h2>4. Subscriptions, billing &amp; cancellations</h2>
          <p>
            Axcended may offer free and paid plans, including subscriptions or
            once-off purchases. Specific details (price, billing period, trial
            terms, benefits) will be shown in the app or relevant store listing
            at the time of purchase.
          </p>

          <h3>4.1 Payments</h3>
          <p>
            Payments are usually processed through app stores or payment
            providers such as Google Play Billing. By starting a paid
            subscription or making a purchase, you authorise the store or
            payment provider to charge you according to the terms shown at
            checkout.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Renewals &amp; cancellation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions typically renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless you cancel.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through the store where you made the purchase (for example, Google Play).</li>
            <li>Cancelling usually stops future charges but may not result in a refund for the current period, unless required by law or our specific offer terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4.3 Changes to pricing</h3>
          <p>
            We may update our pricing or introduce new plans from time to time.
            Where required, we will notify you of changes in advance and give
            you an opportunity to cancel before new prices apply.
          </p>

        <!-- 5. Acceptable use -->
        <section id="acceptable-use">

          <h3>6.1 Your content</h3>

          </p>
          <p>
            You keep ownership of your content. However, by using the Service
            you grant Axcended a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
            licence to host, store, display, process and use your content as

            <li>Operate, secure and improve the app and website.</li>
            <li>Develop features such as progress tracking, recommendations or learning analytics.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to share any
            content you upload and that it does not infringe the rights of
            others.
          </p>

          <h3>6.2 Our content and intellectual property</h3>
          <p>
            The Service, including the Axcended name and logo, designs, text,
            graphics, software and other materials, is owned by or licensed to
            us and is protected by intellectual property laws.

            You may use Axcended only for personal, non-commercial educational
            purposes, unless we give you written permission to use it otherwise
            (for example, as a partner organisation). You may not copy,

          </p>
          <ul>

            The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
            While we aim to keep Axcended helpful, reliable and up-to-date, we
            do not guarantee that the Service will be:

            Educational content, advice and mentoring, whether provided by

            not be liable for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, or</li>

            Where liability cannot be excluded under applicable law, our total
